					<h3>What Fall Leadership Is All About</h3>

				</div>

				<div class="textBox">

					<p>
						&emsp;Fall Leadership is a great time to come as a chapter team and learn what it means to be an officer in TSA, and even what TSA is for those who might have joined for the first time this year. In the morning, you will be taught in small workshops about leadership and TSA. It is a great time to learn some great things to put into practice at you chapter. In the afternoon, the State Officers will give a presentation to their respective office (presidents go to State President, etc.), to learn what your roles are in your specific office. After that, you will have an opportunity to work with your chapter officer team to complete a leadership activity. Overall, it is tons of fun and a great learning experience. We are excited to see you there!!!
